                        Bouldering is a stripped down version of rock climbing.
                        Where you climb a small boulder with just shoes, chalk, and yourself over safety mats.
                        Though it may seem simple, some may prove to be a challenge.
                        There are handfull of problems for you to solve along the way, using a balance of techniques, strength and brain.

                        Bouldering can be challening at first but rewarding later.
                        It is a workout for the body and mind. It is also a social sport,
                        people of all experiences can and are willing to support / guide along your journey.

                        To start your journey in bouldering, you dont need much and eveything required will be avaliable in the climbing center that you go to.
                        But if you would like to know and are planning to take the sport frequently, here's a list:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Climbing shoes (good quality shoes will go a long way)</li>
                            <li>Climbing chalk (keeps hands dry and maintains friction)</li>
                            <li>Chalk bag, to store your chalk. (some come with chalk and a hold brush)</li>
                            <li>Lastly, yourself ;) (have fun!)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>Personal experiences:<br>
                        Just go into the climbing gym and start from there without any equipment.
                        Learning from the staff there, eventually and naturally you'll upgrade and add more things
                        under you belt.
                        But most Importantly, you'll gain experiece and a solid foundation!
